Everything is for Ubuntu/Debian by default, but you will be able to make it work for your distro with minimal adjustments.

### Shell Prompt(Starship)

```bash
make init
```

### Vim

```bash
make vim
```

### NeoVim

```bash
make nvim
```

### Optional

[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is super cool and not optional imo :D

```bash
cargo install ripgrep
pip install pynvim
npm i -g neovim
```
